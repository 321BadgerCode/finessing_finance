**The stock market also displays fluctuations in stock prices using line graphs where each individual stock is a differently colored line. The colors are automatically generated, so you can add many more stocks to the stock list and the stock market graph visualization will scale in accordance.**

> [!WARNING]
> Other than the problems with the graph visualizations already listed in [TO-DO](#-to-do), the line graph visualization also is not perfectly symmetrical as you can tell. The colors mix when they intersect and you can tell that the middle should be white as all of the colors are intersecting. However, the white point looks off-center, because the pixels for different characters are different and I have not created a dynamic system yet to scale the graph in accordance to this. **Also**, the there is a bug where the black lines appear. I haven't gotten to fixing that bug yet. The black lines do not appear if I exclude the code line `graph.resize(10, 10, true);`, so I think the bug derives from the resizing of the graph points.
